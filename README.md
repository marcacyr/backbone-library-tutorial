=========================

Backbone.js library tutorial from the Addy Osmani book.

This is a basic Library where one can add books, remove books,
and update books.

The backend uses MongoDB combined with Node.js and the front-end
uses Backbone.js and html. Templating is done using Underscore.

To start the application, run the following commands in separate shells:

```
mongod
```

```
node server.js
```

Note: You must have MongoDB and Node.js with NPM (node package manager) installed on your system. Choosing the node.js pkg download for MAC comes pre-packaged with NPM and installs it with Node.

The best method for installing MongoDB is to use Home Brew. If you do not have Home Brew, go to http://brew.sh and follow the instructions for installing it.
